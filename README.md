# Rogue Likes

Rogue Likes is a small game designed to rank roguelike pixel art, specifically
Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup art in this case. It should work on recent mobiles.

The rules are simple:
Swipe up to like the top image, swipe down to like the bottom image.
Or tap the arrows on screen or use keyboard arrows up and down.

Every 10th swipe you will get to see the current top 100 liked pixel arts.

That's it. Enjoy!
